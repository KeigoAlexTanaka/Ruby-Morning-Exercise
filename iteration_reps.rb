# 4. You found another survivor! This means you can combine your supplies.
# Create a new combined inventory list out of your zombie_apocalypse_inventory
# and their items below. You should get rid of any duplicate items.

# 3. Our calculations were completely off, turns out all of those animals went
# extinct 3 years before the date provided. Update the values in extinct_animals
# using each, so they accurately reflect what year the animal went extinct. Return the
# entire hash with the updated keys/values.

# 4. You've heard that the following animals might be extinct, but you're not sure.
# Build a method using each that checks if an animal is in the hash and returns true/false.
# Call the method in your driver code with each of the following animals to check if
# they are extinct or not:
# "Andean Cat"
# "Dodo"
# "Saiga Antelope"
# Example: is_extinct?(extinct_animals, "Andean Cat")
p "----------------------------"


# 5. We just found out that the Tasmanian Tiger is actually not extinct!
# Remove them from extinct_animals and return the key/value pair as a two item array.
# Find a Ruby Hash built-in method that helps you accomplish this or build
# your own method using each
