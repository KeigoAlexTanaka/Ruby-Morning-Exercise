# Initialize SANTA CLASS

# set attributes ethnicity, age, gender
# make ethnicity and age readable and gender readable and writable


# define instance methods for gender, ethnicity, age

# write a speak method giving Santa something to say


# write a eat_milk_and_cookies method with a cookie_type parameter
# write statement saying that was a good cookie and print the cookie


# write a reindeer_ranking method with all of santas reindeers


# write celebrate_birthday method indicating Santa is now one year older


#Initialize Santa class starting with a male, polynesian Santa


# Print methods for Santa class



# Print Santa's age

# Print Santa's latest age

# Print method that moves reindeer position, Vixen is now last, Vixen knows what he did

# Print Santa's ethnicity

# Re-assign gender attribute


# Add more Santas to the class
# create a santas array

# declare nine example_genders
example_genders = ["agender", "female", "transgender", "male", "non-binary", "gender fluid", "N/A", "female", "gender queer"]
# declare nine example_ethnicities
example_ethnicities = ["black", "Latino", "white", "Japanese-African", "prefer not to say", "Mystical Creature (unicorn)", "Portuguese", "Inuit", "South African"]
# Create nine new santas to add to our santas array:
# loop through the example_genders array and for each gender, push the new santa with one of the ethnicities from example_ethnicities
# into our santas array




# Set santas value to zero

# Loop through the Santas 10 times to provide random genders, ethnicities and ages for Santas
# For clarity, inside the loop, add this line: puts "New Santa data:"
# print a random gender and ethnicity for each iteration, this may require a look at the ruby docs for arrays
# Santas age should range from 0 to 140
